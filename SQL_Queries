ORDER BY 3,4;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 1.) Pick The Data I Want To Use

--(There is a lot of data in this csv and not all of it I want to use right now.)
--(I will pull only what I want to use first before continuing.)
--(I feel like ordering it beased on the location and date would make the most sense.)

SELECT location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM master..CovidDeaths
ORDER BY 1,2;

--(I'm curious to see what toatl cases vs. total deaths looks like for the data.)
--(I feel like pulling this as a ratio would make sense.)
--(To do this, I will have to divide the total deaths by total cases then multiply the result by 100 to get a percentage.)
--(I got an error reminding me that I can't divide by zero so I had to modify my query just a titch by adding a CASE function.)
--(in addition to this, I didn't realize I had set one of my data columns to 'int' instead of 'float'.)
--(This resulted in a zero for all of my percentages. To get around this, I modified the type for that column first.)

ALTER TABLE master..CovidDeaths
ALTER COLUMN total_deaths FLOAT;

SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths,
CASE 
WHEN total_cases = 0 THEN 0
ELSE (total_deaths/total_cases)*100
END AS DeathPercentage
FROM master..CovidDeaths
ORDER BY 1,2;

--(This is still a bit unfocused. Let me look at the United States specificallty.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2.) Find the highest death percentage rate and corresponding location in the United States Territories

SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths,
CASE 
WHEN total_cases = 0 THEN 0
ELSE (total_deaths/total_cases)*100
END AS DeathPercentage
FROM master..CovidDeaths
WHERE location like '%states%'
ORDER BY 1,2;

--(This is  alot easier to look at.)
--(When just scrolling up to look at how the death percentage chance changes over time, it is interesting to see a steady decrease in the percentage)
--(with each passing day. This tells me that according to the data, the percentage chance of death if someone contracts covid slowly got less and less
--(lethal as time went on. It's probably a no brainer when you thbink about it, but it is really cool to see actual data for this!!)
--(Let's see when, where, and what the highest rate was in the US.)

SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths,
CASE WHEN total_cases = 0 THEN 0
ELSE (CAST(total_deaths AS FLOAT) / total_cases) * 100
END AS DeathPercentage
FROM master..CovidDeaths
WHERE location LIKE '%states%'
ORDER BY DeathPercentage DESC;

--(It seems that at the peak of Covid-19 around May 17th, 2020 that the death percentage rate got up to about 8.69% and some change in the US Virgin Islands.)
--(Rough estimation using the data tells me that for every 100 cases there were around 8.69 deaths around the peak of Covid-19.)
>>> United States Virgin Islands	2020-05-17	69	6	8.695652173913043

--(I am careful to note that there was a very small "sample size" of cases for the Virgin Islands at this time.)
--(With only 69 cases, even a few deaths thought to be caused by covid could really throw off acurate measurements just going by this.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 3.) Find what the total rate of Covid-19 cases vs. Population of the United States

--!!!NOTE!!!: (I am almost positive that this data set does not account for individuals having contracted Covid-19 multiple times.)
--(The purpose of what I am doing here is to show competency with MySQL. Please study the data for yourself before drawing any conclusions
--(From a graduate student's project)

SELECT location, date, total_cases, Population,
CASE 
WHEN total_cases = 0 THEN 0
ELSE (CAST(total_cases AS FLOAT) / population) * 100
END AS CasePercentage
FROM master..CovidDeaths
WHERE location LIKE '%states%'
ORDER BY 1,2;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 4.) Find what countries have the highest infection rate compared to population

SELECT location, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, population,
MAX(CASE WHEN population = 0 THEN 0 ELSE (CAST(total_cases AS FLOAT) / population) * 100
END) AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM master..CovidDeaths
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY PercentPopulationInfected DESC;

--(It appears that the highest infection rate copared to population belongs to Cyprus.)
-- > Cyprus	696410	896007	77.72372314055582
--(Again, the data does not account for repeat cases of individuals having contracted Covid-19 multiple times.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 5.) Find the countries with the highest total death count

--(I want to look at the countries with the highest deaths per population, but under the location column)
--(There are a bunch of grouped locations like South America or World. By looking at the dataset, this is)
--(usually the case for rows where there are null values for continient)

SELECT location, MAX(total_deaths) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM master..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC;

--(It appears that the United States is leading with the highest total deaths. Brazil is 2nd highest abd India is 3rd highest.)
-- > United States	1193165
-- > Brazil	702116
-- > India	533623


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 6.) Find what continent has the highest total death count

--(Although the United States leads with the highest death count, I wonder what continent has the highest death count.)

SELECT continent, MAX(total_deaths) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM master..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY continent
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC;

--(It appears that overall North America carries the highest death count by a wide margin.)
--(I did not think that would be the case. However, this is not a perfect representation either as the number)
--(of deaths for North America is the same as it is for the United States, which tells me that Canada and Mexico)
--(were left out.)
-- > North America	1193165
--(Let me try to run it with the continent is null since it seems that it totalled the different variables from different)
--(continents and seems to have labeled them as a continent under location.)

SELECT location, MAX(total_deaths) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM master..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NULL
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC;

--(Now this makes much more sense. Europe actually leads the data with North America in 2nd.)
--(If you are following along with the data you will see that we also have countries grouped by income and the world total as well)
--(I will post the query results below for you to see. It is actually pretty intersting although I do not know how they categorized)
--(the countries by their income and what criteria or threshold they used to separate them.)
-- > World	7057132
-- > High-income countries	2997359
-- > Upper-middle-income countries	2824452
-- > Europe	2102483
-- > North America	1671178
-- > Asia	1637249
-- > South America	1354187
-- > European Union (27)	1262988
-- > Lower-middle-income countries	1188026
-- > Africa	259117
-- > Low-income countries	43529
-- > Oceania	32918


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 7.) Find the death rate for Covid-19 the entire world

--(As if this was not already morbid enough, I would like to see what the death rate for the entire world)
--(is according to the data. Setting this one up was a bit tricky and took me a minute.)

SELECT SUM(new_cases) AS total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths AS float)) AS total_deaths, SUM(cast
(total_deaths AS float)) /SUM(total_cases) *100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM master..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2;

--(Apparently the total death rate for the world was around 1.119%)
-- > 775935057	7060988	1.119182970860101


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 8.) Find the total percentage of people vaccinated 

--(This one was extremely sticky.)
--(I wanted to learn something new while doing this so I used a CTE as well as a temp table.)
--(This was my first time using a temp table and honestly, I really like it.)

--(Using CTE)
WITH PopsVac (Continent, Location, Date, Population, New_Vaccinations, RollingPeopleVaccinated) AS 
(
    SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations, 
    SUM(CONVERT(float, vac.new_vaccinations)) 
    OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) 
    AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
    FROM master..CovidDeaths dea
    JOIN master..CovidVaccinations vac
    ON dea.location = vac.location
    AND dea.date = vac.date
    WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100 AS PercentPeopleVaccinated
FROM PopsVac
ORDER BY Location, Date;

--(Using temp table)
--(Dropping temp table after my query is executed)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #PercentPopulationVaccinated
--(Using a temp table to store the results)
CREATE TABLE #PercentPopulationVaccinated
(Continent NVARCHAR(255), Location NVARCHAR(255), Date DATETIME, Population NUMERIC, New_Vaccinations NUMERIC, RollingPeopleVaccinated NUMERIC);

--(Adding the data to my temp table)
INSERT INTO #PercentPopulationVaccinated 
SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations, SUM(CONVERT(float, vac.new_vaccinations)) 
OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location 
ORDER BY dea.date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
FROM master..CovidDeaths dea
JOIN master..CovidVaccinations vac
ON dea.location = vac.location
AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL;

--(Calculating the rate from the data in my temp table.)
SELECT *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population) * 100 AS PercentPeopleVaccinated
FROM #PercentPopulationVaccinated
ORDER BY Location, Date;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 9.) Create view to store data for visualization 

--(I will work with Tableau later with some of my queries so I need to store them as a view.)

--(4) What countries have the highest infection rate compared to population
CREATE VIEW CountriesTotalInfectionRate AS
SELECT location, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, population,
MAX(CASE WHEN population = 0 THEN 0 ELSE (CAST(total_cases AS FLOAT) / population) * 100
END) AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM master..CovidDeaths
GROUP BY location, population;

SELECT *
FROM CountriesTotalInfectionRate;

---(4.5) What countries have the highest infection rate compared to population with date
CREATE VIEW CountriesTotalInfectionRateWdate AS
SELECT location, date, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, population,
MAX(CASE WHEN population = 0 THEN 0 ELSE (CAST(total_cases AS FLOAT) / population) * 100
END) AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM master..CovidDeaths
GROUP BY location, population, date;

SELECT *
FROM CountriesTotalInfectionRateWdate;

--(5) What countries have the highest death count
CREATE VIEW CountriesTotalDeathCount AS
SELECT location, MAX(total_deaths) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM master..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location;

SELECT *
FROM CountriesTotalDeathCount;

--(7) Death rate for Covid-19 the entire world
CREATE VIEW WorldDeathRate AS
SELECT SUM(new_cases) AS total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths AS float)) AS total_deaths, SUM(cast
(total_deaths AS float)) /SUM(total_cases) *100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM master..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL;

--(6) What continent has the highest total death count
CREATE VIEW ContinentTotalDeathCount AS
SELECT location, MAX(total_deaths) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM master..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NULL
AND LOCATION NOT IN ('World', 'European Union', 'International', 'High-income countries', 
    'Upper-middle-income countries', 'Lower-middle-income countries', 'Low-income countries', 
    'European Union (27)')
GROUP BY location;

SELECT *
FROM ContinentTotalDeathCount;

--(They work! I am so happy with these.)
